Early stages of a project that will introduce C# integration into UE4. 
 

# Risks
1. How  will variable replication be accomplished? (Use annotations?)
2. Function replication
3. Get inheritance working

# Annotations
1. Would need to employ annotations (C#). There will be generated boilerplate/glue in the assembly that would know how to push that definition
